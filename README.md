# reflect.

## firefox dev branch

"a mindful website blocker for the productive."

reflect is a digitally mindful chrome extension that encourages users to reflect on their relationship with technology.

when you attempt to visit distracting websites, reflect will ask you what your intention in doing so is. if you have a valid reason, you are allowed to enter the website; if not, you are encouraged to reflect further.

## Building the project

1. Ensure you have [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) installed.
2. Then, install the `node` package dependencies by doing `npm i`.
3. Finally, `npm run build`.

## Git Workflow

1. Get an up to date version of the remote by doing `git pull`
2. Create a new branch BEFORE you start working by doing `git checkout -b ###-NAME-OF-BRANCH` where `NAME-OF-BRANCH` describes the new thing you're working on and `###` is the ticket number. e.g. `git checkout -b 001-add-feature`
3. Then, make your changes
4. Add files for staging by doing `git add .`
5. Commit these changes by doing `git commit -m "describe changes here"`
6. Push these changes to the remote repository by doing `git push origin ###-NAME-OF-BRANCH` where the branch name is the same as above. You can always do `git branch` to see which branch you are on.
7. Make a pull-request on Github!

### Using different intent classifiers

Just drop them into `dist/res/models/` and call it in `src/background.ts`:

```typescript
// Load ML model stuff
const model: IntentClassifier = new IntentClassifier("acc84.78");
```
